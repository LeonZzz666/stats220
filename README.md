# Stats220
*Hello everyone, I'm a student of [UoA](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html).* 

**Wellcome to my [Stats220 repo.](https://github.com/LeonZzz666/stats220)**

## The purpose of the repo
1. This is my Assignment1 about making a meme.
   
2. I think this meme vividly depicts how people behave when they are frustrated. 

**Let's see itÔºÅ**
